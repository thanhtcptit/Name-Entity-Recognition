PAD PAD " Ukraine 's biggest achievements for five years are the preservation of civil peace and inter-ethnic harmony , " President Leonid Kuchma said in televised statement this week . PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD " Unlike many other post-Soviet countries we were able to deal with conflict situations in a peaceful and civilised way . " PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD But independence was initially accompanied by hyper-inflation and economic collapse , although there are signs of a turnaround . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD " There is no doubt that economic growth has already started , " said Adelbert Knobl , head of the International Monetary Fund 's mission in Ukraine . " PAD PAD PAD

PAD PAD Barter deals were worth $ 4.9 billion last year , or about eight percent of all Russian exports estimated at $ 61.5 billion , she said . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD " If traders are late , they will have to pay fines worth the cost of their exported goods , " Volkova said . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD Barter has always been a feature of the Soviet Union 's foreign trade , but Yeltsin 's decrees liberalising foreign trade in 1991-1992 has given barter a new impetus . PAD PAD
PAD PAD " Now many Russian banks are strong and can make various sorts of money tranfers , while incompetent traders are being ousted by more experienced ones . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD

PAD PAD It 's an inexorable change . " PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD After World War II , corporations adopted a " military model " creating hierarchical organisations where " the concept of defined tasks worked great , " she said . PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD But as the economy became global , customers were more demanding and problems became more complex . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD " Multi-layers kept management at a distance from its customers , " O'Neal said . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD Now organisations must change to stay competitive . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD O'Neal says firms will place a greater emphasis on teams and team performance in giving raises . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD If your team does well , you 'll do well . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD If it does n't do well , do n't expect a raise . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD Is this fair to an employee who can go the distance but is on a team that ca n't keep up ? PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD " That 's an important question we used to ask a lot , " said O'Neal . " PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD It 's not a question we ask any more . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD

PAD PAD Companies that can change their culture and view employees as business partners will do well , O'Neal said . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD For example , the survey rated some participants in the survey as " high-performing " companies , based on their return on equity above 16 percent . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD Those companies also said they already offer employees variable pay and business education , give their managers more control over pay decisions and celebrate employee and team success . PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD " They respect employees more , they trust employees more and they value their employees more , " O'Neal said . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD " The key to success at high-performance companies is engaging employees in a business partnership . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD

PAD PAD At a news conference attended by approximately 50 players on Sunday , U.S. Davis Cup player Todd Martin expressed the players ' outrage at the seedings . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD

PAD PAD But once the 27-year-old Stich got on the court , he focused his energies on trying to win the year 's last Grand Slam . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD He took a positive first step with his 6-3 1-6 6-1 7-5 win over compatriot Haas on a sun-baked Grandstand court . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD The suspicion , however , lingers in Stich 's mind that U.S. Open officials did tamper with the seeding process in order to benefit homegrown players . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD It was Agassi who was at the centre of the controversy that engulfed the tournament since the original draw was completed on Wednesday . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD The flamboyant American star was bumped up two spots from his ATP ranking of eight to a seeding of six . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD

PAD PAD The Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday approved rules designed to give stock market investors a better chance at getting the best price available for their orders . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD The so-called order handling rules , which were proposed last September , were approved in a 4-0 vote . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD The rules will also require that customer limit orders be displayed with prices better than those available in quotes publicly available at the time . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD Specialists and market makers are companies or individuals recognised as qualified to maintain an orderly market in a stock . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD In a limit order , investors specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell , as opposed to a market order executed at prevailing prices . PAD PAD
PAD PAD The SEC 's goal , he added , was to create " one system where one price could be available to everybody . " PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD In proposing the rules last year , the SEC noted that while technology has improved , commonplace practices still existed that worked against investors ' best interests . PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD It noted that customers whose orders were not displayed lost the chance of getting the best possible price available in the market . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD The agency said it would monitor effects of the two new rules before considering the " price improvement " proposal again . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD

PAD PAD Outspoken Andrei Medvedev exchanged his reputation as the clown prince of tennis on Wednesday for a new no-nonsense attitude that has made life on the courts fun again . PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD It was Medvedev 's sixth victory in a row after winning his first tournament of the year last week at the Hamlet Cup . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD " The whole day I 'm thinking abnout tennis . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD I felt that all the other things I was doing the years before , they were distracting me , they were not helping me at all . " PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD " I 'm not here to fight the press or talk about the food or entertain the people off the court . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD I 'm here to play tennis and to win . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD I have much less fun off the court . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD I have much more fun on the court , " he said . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD Just three years ago Medvedev was one of the world 's best , with a ranking of six after reaching the French Open semifinal and winning three tournaments . PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD But Medvedev 's ranking slowly began to drop last year as he struggled with a wrist injury . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD The Ukrainian finally hit a low of 44th two months ago . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD " It 's somewhere where I would n't like to stay very long , " Medvedev said of his current ranking of 36 . " PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD It 's a part of the penalty that I have to accept . " PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD As part of his new businesslike approach , Medvedev hired Australian coach Bob Brett at the start of this year and the partnership is beginning to pay off . PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD " At the beginning of the year we started from zero , " said Medvedev . " PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD Winning in Long Island ( last week ) was like winning for the first time . " PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD While Medvedev 's 77-minute romp past Fleurian was rather ordinary , the fact that the two were playing each other was rather remarkable . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD In the original draw , Medvedev and Fleurian were slotted to play each other . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD When controversy forced the draw to be done over -- against odds of 151-to-1 -- Medvedev and Fleurian drew each other a second time . PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD " When I saw the new draw I did n't have to change my preparation , " Medvedev said . " PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD

PAD PAD A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday gave Lloyd 's a reprieve , throwing out an injunction that the insurance giant said could have led to its collapse . PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD " My prediction is that the Names will appeal , " said Kenneth Chiate , a U.S. Name and a chief negotiator for the American Names Association . PAD PAD PAD PAD
PAD PAD " At this point , it is a sufficiently important decision that I 'm confident that they will appeal , " he said . " PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD PAD

PAD PAD Norton said she was concerned that the Lloyd 's agreement immunizes it from future litigation regarding Equitas and requires that all legal actions be heard outside of Colorado . PAD PAD PAD
